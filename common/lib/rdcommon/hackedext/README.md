This directory contains (license-compatible) code from other projects that has
been hacked up for one reason or another and placed into this codebase.

The rationale is likely one or more of the following:
- This is a temporary thing until we can work something out with upstream.
- The upstream code is in flux and our needs are believed to be unique enough
   that we should not try and saddle upstream with our needs until upstream
   crystallizes their strategy/etc.
- We are being pedantic about something.
