What are these files?

Actual app logic:
    main.js

Third party libraries:
    q.js

JSCtypes bindings that are still relevant:
    nacl.js

Jetpack shims that are still relevant and so these files may migrate:
    websocket.js

Shims to look like node.js:
    child_process.js
    event-queue.js
    fs.js
    http.js
    microtime.js
    path.js
    util.js

Hacky jetpack support that is probably moot:
    indexdbshim.js
