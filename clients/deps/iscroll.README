iscroll was modified to fix an error on first inclusion, and to allow
clicks into text area/form inputs to work.

The text input fix was done looking at this pull request for iscroll:
https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/pull/38/files

The change was put into the default implementation for onBeforeScrollStart.

I forgot the other change I did for the startup error, do a diff against
a stock 4.1.5 version of iscroll.
